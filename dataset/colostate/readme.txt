In 2011-2012, the brain-computer interface (BCI) research group at Colorado State University recorded EEG signals from
subjects in our lab and from subjects with motor impairments in their homes. Three different EEG systems were used for
each subject, one goal being to determine if inexpensive EEG systems are as effective as more expensive ones for
conducting BCI experiments in the home. This data is publicly available from this web site by making selections below.
The data is fairly large files in zipped JSON format. Multiple selections will be combined into one zipped archive.
This data was collected with the support of the National Science Foundation through Award 1065513 and is made available
by the Department of Computer Science at Colorado State University.
